# Wibbly Witch Mod
Let's get wibbling.
### Key Ideas
Starting relic lets the player choose a common spell and always draw it on the first turn, because having control over the starting spell seems important.
### Intended Archetypes
**Spell Spammer**. Get lots of low delay spells and powers that have effects whenever a spell is evoked.\
**Big Spells**. Get high delay spells and spend those turns improving the effects of the spell for big damage when it evokes.\
**Martial Witch**. Still depends on spells, but cares less about the damage they provide. For example, there will be a class of wyrd cards that repeat once for every delay.
